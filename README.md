# 5 Encryption Terms
## Here are some terms
> Let's go :fire: :fire: :fire: :fire:

# Frequency Analysis

> Finding the patterns of the language in which the code is written, and then using those patterns to find patterns in the code.
> Usually only works on monoalphabetic cyphers.

# CRIBS

> Specific words used very often in language that can be identified in ciphers and then used as a way to crack it

# Polyalphabetic Cypher

> A cypher where the way the alphabet is scrambled changes during the written code so that there a tremendously more combinations possible. 
> An example of this is the ViginiÃ©re method. Uses a grid in which the alphabets are scrambled.

# One-time Encryption Pad

> Uses a key that is as long as the written message itself so that there are no possible patterns so analyze. Also, the key used for one cypher is never the same, as after being used it is destroyed. 

# Asymmetric Cryptosystem

> When one one the encryption key is public and the other one is private. So that not both the links know the key. (HTTPS)
